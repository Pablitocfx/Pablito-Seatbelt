# Pablito-Seatbelt
Simple Seatbelt System with automatic death at whatever ejection speed set in config. Lots of customization with your own custom noises for 3 different settings.
if You do not know how to add custom noises to interact-sound check out their docs here

https://plunkettscott.gitbooks.io/scott-s-script-documentation/content/scripts/interactsound.html

Feel Free to do whatever you want to this. You can find your own noises to use and just search for -

Buckled (seatbelt noise)
Eject (window shatter noise)
Dashboard (No seatbelt in Vehicle)
Will be doing an update soon as some things to still fix are. Dashboard does not play when players are unbuckled in passenger seats.
