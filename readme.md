Simple Seatbelt Script for Server Owners that don't know how to create one and don't have one built into their HUD
its a simple install. 

if You do not know how to add custom noises to interact-sound check out their docs here 

https://plunkettscott.gitbooks.io/scott-s-script-documentation/content/scripts/interactsound.html


Feel Free to do whatever you want to this. You can find your own noises to use and just search for - 
1. Buckled (seatbelt noise)
2. Eject (window shatter noise)
3. Dashboard (No seatbelt in Vehicle)

Will be doing an update soon as some things to still fix are. Dashboard does not play when players are unbuckled in passenger seats.
